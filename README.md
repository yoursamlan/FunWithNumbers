## Welcome to Fun with Numbers
### by Amlan Saha Kundu 

Fun with Number is created to play with various numbers with the help of Python programming language. Here you can learn so many different types of numbers. Like...
- [Perfect Number](https://github.com/yoursamlan/FunWithNumbers/blob/master/04%20Perfect%20Number%20.py)
- [Amicable Number](https://github.com/yoursamlan/FunWithNumbers/blob/master/05%20Amicable%20Number%20.py)
- [Father and Child Prime](https://github.com/yoursamlan/FunWithNumbers/blob/master/06%20Child%20Prime%20.py)
etc.
Also, I have analyzed the trend on number of factors of positive integers upto 100. Surprisingly the highest no. of factors upto hundred is 12 and that have occured exactly 5 times. Here is the [visualization](https://github.com/yoursamlan/FunWithNumbers/blob/master/02%20Visualize%20the%20Number%20of%20factors%20trend%20.py)

Data:
```
[1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 6, 2, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 2, 6, 4, 4, 2, 8, 3, 4, 4, 6, 2, 8, 2, 6, 4, 4, 4, 9, 2, 4, 4, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 6, 4, 2, 10, 3, 6, 4, 6, 2, 8, 4, 8, 4, 4, 2, 12, 2, 4, 6, 7, 4, 8, 2, 6, 4, 8, 2, 12, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 8, 2, 10, 5, 4, 2, 12, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 12, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 12, 2, 6, 6, 9]
```
I will update and analyze the afore-mentioned result shortly.
